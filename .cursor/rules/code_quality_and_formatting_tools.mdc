# Code Quality and Formatting Tools

This project uses `ktlint` for code formatting and `detekt` for static code analysis to maintain code quality and consistency.

**Key Guidelines from [README.md](mdc:README.md):**
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Line length: 120 characters
- Kotlin official code style
- No wildcard imports
- Consistent naming conventions

**Gradle Commands (from [README.md](mdc:README.md)):**
- To manually check code style: `./gradlew checkCodeStyle`
- To format code manually: `./gradlew ktlintFormat`

Refer to the [README.md](mdc:README.md) for more details.
The build configuration for these tools can be influenced by [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts) and potentially `app/build.gradle.kts`.
Detekt configuration is located in `config/detekt/` (e.g., `config/detekt/detekt.yml`).
