# Kotlin Coding Style Requirements

*   Adhere strictly to the official Kotlin Coding Conventions. No deviations are permitted unless explicitly documented and approved.
*   Use descriptive and unambiguous names for all identifiers.
*   Lines must not exceed 120 characters.
*   Mandatory 4-space indentation.
*   Strictly organize and remove all unused imports.

For project-specific linting rules and tools like `ktlint` and `detekt`, also see [code_quality_and_formatting_tools.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/code_quality_and_formatting_tools.mdc) and the [README.md](mdc:README.md).
