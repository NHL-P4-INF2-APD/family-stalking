# Build System and CI/CD

## Build System
The project uses Gradle as its build system. 
- Main build configuration: [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts)
- App-specific configuration: `app/build.gradle.kts` (typically)
- Settings: [settings.gradle.kts](mdc:settings.gradle.kts)

## CI/CD Pipeline
The project utilizes GitHub Actions for its CI/CD pipeline, defined in `.github/workflows/`.
The pipeline (as per [README.md](mdc:README.md)) automates:
- Building the application with Gradle
- Static code analysis with Detekt
- Unit tests with JUnit 5
- Code coverage reports with JaCoCo
- Generation of release artifacts (APK)

Refer to the [README.md](mdc:README.md) for more details.
