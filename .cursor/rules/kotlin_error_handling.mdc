# Kotlin Error Handling Standards

*   Exceptions are reserved for truly exceptional, unrecoverable conditions.
*   For expected outcomes that may involve success or failure, a `Result` type or equivalent must be used.
*   Error messages must be clear, concise, and provide sufficient context for immediate diagnosis.
