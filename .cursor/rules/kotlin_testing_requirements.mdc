# Kotlin Testing Requirements

*   Comprehensive unit tests are mandatory for all functions and classes.
*   Integration tests are required to verify interactions between components.
*   Testing must utilize the designated project testing framework (e.g., JUnit, Kotest).

Refer to the [README.md](mdc:README.md) for project-specific testing tools like JUnit 5 and JaCoCo.
